ðŸ›’ Consumer product transaction records and recalls.

***


Consumer electronic marketplaces would be much safer if all electric consumer product transactions were recorded and further customer information was recorded for cash transactions. Strict use of recorded 
transactions for electrical consumer products would allow very easy safety recalls. Any consumer electrical product that needs to obtain certifications like CE marking for Europe, FCC for the United States, and 
CCC for China, should be sold using only digitally recorded transactions. If these products are purchased with cash then further customer information should be required.

On November 4, 2023, Lenovo USB-C Laptop Power Banks were recalled due to fire hazard as internal screws can come loose, causing a short circuit and overheating of the lithium-ion battery. About 2,850 units were 
affected in the US and 510 in Canada. Not all of Lenovo's customers will repair, replace, dispose or requested a refund.
